"""The game's save and speech predicates, taken from the sources and run
over every combination of the dangers they weigh, to record when it is
quiet, safe to save and safe to speak, as the native engine's must say.

    python3 tools/engine_safety_reference.py          # writes the reference
    python3 tools/engine_safety_reference.py --check  # fails if it is stale

The functions are source/game/game.c's `game_all_quiet`,
`game_safe_to_save`, `game_safe_to_speak` and `game_is_cooperative`, found
by name as tools/harness finds them and compiled for this machine against
a fake world whose eight dangers (`ai_enemies_can_see_player`,
`dangerous_projectiles_near_player` and the rest) are set from the bits of
a number, all 256 of them, and whose `player_spawn_count` runs from none to
four. How the game decides each danger is left out.

The trace is written to engine/crates/sim/tests/safety_reference.txt, which
engine/crates/sim/tests/safety_reference.rs reads.
