"""When the game's multiplayer rules end a game, taken from the sources, to
check the engine's `Rules` against.

    python3 tools/engine_game_end_reference.py          # writes the reference
    python3 tools/engine_game_end_reference.py --check  # fails if it is stale

The functions are source/game/game_engine.c's `game_engine_should_end_game`,
`multiple_teams_alive` and `players_in_game`, compiled for this machine
against a fake player table. A game ends when fewer than two teams have a
player in it, or when its time limit is up. The cases are every game of up
to five players, with and without teams, each player on either team, alive
or dead, with no time limit or one of a minute, just before and at its end.

The engine has no lives and no odd man out, and no one quits, so the fake
`game_engine_player_is_out_of_lives` and `game_engine_player_is_odd_man_out`
say no and no player has quit: every player counts as in the game.

The trace is written to engine/crates/sim/tests/game_end_reference.txt,
which engine/crates/sim/tests/game_end_reference.rs reads.
