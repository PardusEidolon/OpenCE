"""A C compiler for the reference traces that builds them as wasm32 and runs
them in the game's runtime (opence_runtime), so that a trace recorded from
the wasm build can be compared with the native one.

    CC="$PWD/tools/engine_wasm_cc.py" python3 tools/engine_foo_reference.py --check

The reference scripts (tools/engine_*_reference.py) compile their harness
with $CC, as `$CC <flags> source.c -o executable -lm`, and run the
executable. This compiles the same source for wasm32-wasip1 with the game's
ABI flags (tools/engine_wasm.py) into executable.wasm, and writes
executable as a script that runs it with the runtime's `opence-wasm`
($OPENCE_WASM_RUN), whose output is the harness's own. A script whose
--check passes this way has the same trace in the wasm build as natively.

With $OPENCE_WASM_SPEED naming a folder, it also builds the harness
natively ($OPENCE_NATIVE_CC, clang by default) as executable.native, and
the executable times both runs (and an empty process, the baseline) into
the folder's speed.jsonl, the wasm run's load and run apart as opence-wasm
reports them; tools/engine_wasm_traces.py --speed sums them up.
