"""The game's multiplayer announcer, taken from the sources and run over
games of every type, to record which of its sounds play and when, as the
native engine's announcer must.

    python3 tools/engine_announcer_reference.py          # writes the reference
    python3 tools/engine_announcer_reference.py --check  # fails if it is stale

The functions are source/game/game_engine_multiplayer_sounds.c's queue
(`game_engine_intialize_queued_sounds`, `game_engine_play_multiplayer_sound`,
`game_engine_update_multiplayer_sound` and the static helpers behind them),
source/game/game_engine.c's `game_engine_initialize_for_new_map` (which
empties the queue), `game_engine_game_starting` and
`game_engine_has_teams`, and the game types' `game_starting`: Slayer's,
Capture the Flag's, King of the Hill's and Oddball's. They are found by
name as tools/harness finds them and compiled for this machine against a
fake world: the globals' multiplayer information with a table of sounds,
some missing, of random lengths, and a stand-in for the sound that prints
what plays. Each game starts as a new map and `game_initial_pulse` start it, then plays random sounds over its ticks, the
queue stepping once a tick as `game_engine_update` steps it. Ting (the last
sound), which nothing plays and the queue's flags do not reach, is left
out.

The trace is written to engine/crates/sim/tests/announcer_reference.txt,
which engine/crates/sim/tests/announcer_reference.rs reads.
