//! The coverage census (conductor/tracks/coverage_census_20261026):
//! every function of the original (`source/`) classed against the
//! engine, with the evidence its class asks for.
//!
//! The census reads the original's symbol headers (its functions, their
//! addresses and sizes), the names the engine's Rust and Swift cite in
//! their comments, the original's call graph, and `engine/census.toml`,
//! which holds the classes. `opence census` writes `docs/census.md` and
//! the summary in `docs/engine.md`; the crate's tests are its check.
