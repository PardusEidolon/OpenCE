//! The app's hold on the keyboard and mouse while the game runs.
//! `halo_game_main` keeps the [`crate::Game`] busy for the whole run, so
//! the app takes a [`Controls`] first ([`crate::Game::controls`]) and hands
//! it the keys and the mouse from its own thread; the game reads them at
//! its own pace, through the input imports (the input module).
//!
//! The app's keys are macOS's virtual key codes (`NSEvent.keyCode`,
//! Carbon's `kVK_` constants), given to the game as the Windows virtual
//! keys its bindings name ([`virtual_key`]). Nothing but the keyboard and
//! the mouse is ever the game's controller: there is no entry here for a
//! pad, and the app does not listen for one.
