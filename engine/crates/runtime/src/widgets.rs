//! The plugins' reader of the game's live widget tree: the screens the
//! original's UI code (interface/ui_widget.c) has open for each local
//! player, each widget as `struct widget_instance` lays it out in
//! game.wasm, reached from `ui_widget_globals_storage`'s `active_widgets`.
//!
//! What a widget looks like (its bounds, its bitmaps, its font) is in its
//! definition, the `DeLa` tag `definition` names, which the importer has
//! read from the map already; the tree says which are open, where they
//! have been moved, which has the focus and what text the game has given
//! them. As with every view, it is untrusted: each pointer is checked
//! against the memory, the walk stops at a widget it has seen, and it
//! reads at most [`MAXIMUM_WIDGETS`] widgets and [`MAXIMUM_DEPTH`] levels.
