//! The keyboard and mouse, as the game's input imports read them: the
//! Xbox's controller and debug keyboard (`XInput*`) and the Linux port's
//! hooks for the mouse's look and the keyboard's actions. Each follows the
//! Linux port (`port/linux/src/xinput_sdl.c`), with the layouts of the
//! project's own header (`port/include/xdk/`). There is no gamepad: the
//! keyboard and mouse are the first controller, and nothing else is.
//!
//! The app hands the keys and the mouse to the [`crate::Game`]'s host
//! methods as Windows' virtual keys and SDL's button numbers; the game
//! reads them at its own pace, through these imports.
