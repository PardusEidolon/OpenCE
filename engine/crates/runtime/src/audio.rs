//! The game's mixed sound on its way to the speakers. The mixer is the
//! Linux port's (`port/linux/src/dsound_sdl.c`), compiled into the game: a
//! thread of the game's mixes and hands its frames, 48 kHz stereo floats,
//! to `halo_audio_output`, which keeps them in a ring and, once the ring
//! is below its target, answers how many more to mix. The app pulls them
//! from the ring on Core Audio's thread ([`Speakers`]), as the macOS VM
//! port's host pulled them from its guest (`port/macos/host/host_audio.c`).
//!
//! While nothing pulls (headless, or the device stopped), the ring drains
//! at the output's rate by the clock, as the Linux port's silent clock
//! thread mixed without a device, so the game's streams still play out in
//! time.
