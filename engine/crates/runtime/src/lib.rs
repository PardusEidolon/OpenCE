//! The game's runtime: `source/` built as `game.wasm` (tools/engine_wasm.py),
//! compiled by Wasmtime with Cranelift and run inside the macOS app.
//!
//! A [`Runtime`] holds the engine and, when given a folder, Wasmtime's cache
//! of compiled modules, keyed by Wasmtime's version, the compiler's settings
//! and the CPU's features, so the game compiles once per machine and build.
//! [`Runtime::load`] instantiates a module with a stub for every function it
//! imports: each stub records its call and returns zeros, until the platform
//! supplies the real ones. `proc_exit` ends the call with [`Error::Exit`],
//! and `fd_write` keeps what is written, per descriptor ([`Game::output`]),
//! so the reference harnesses run as WASI commands ([`Game::run_command`]).
//! A call budget ([`Game::set_call_budget`]) ends a game that, on stubs,
//! never returns.
//!
//! The module and its memory are untrusted: a trap is an error, never a
//! panic, and the memory is read and written only through checked ranges.
