//! The Metal device's render batches. The game's Direct3D is the Metal
//! device compiled into game.wasm (`port/macos/guest/d3d8_metal_device.c`),
//! which writes its commands into a batch in its own memory
//! (`port/macos/include/opence_render.h`) and rings `host_render_submit`.
//! Each batch is copied out, checked by one [`RenderValidator`] that
//! keeps the objects of the batches before it, and what passed is handed
//! to the app's renderer ([`RenderSink`]) with a read-only view of the
//! memory its uploads name, then to the plugins at the render hook. The
//! answer is how many commands were refused, or -1 for a batch refused
//! whole, as the VM's host answers (`port/macos/host/host_render.c`).
//!
//! The renderer answers with the textures it read back ([`Readback`]),
//! each written into the game's memory only where a ReadTexture of the
//! batch names ([`readback_fits`]); one that does not fit is refused and
//! logged with the rest.
